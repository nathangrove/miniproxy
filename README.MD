Miniproxy is a simple backproxy that enables you to access your IP address from anywhere in the world. It sets up and runs a local SOCKS5 proxy on your remoate machine. Then it calls back to a server (tunnel server) to start a tunnel to listen for commands from the server. When the proxy calls back to the tunnel server, the firewalls are bypassed. This then allows you to connect to the tunnel server and use it as a relay to relay all TCP traffic through. I use the software for connecting to various servers that are only accessible through my home IP address.
